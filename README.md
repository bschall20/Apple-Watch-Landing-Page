# Apple-Watch-Landing-Page
Landing page modeled after the Apple website watches page! Made in Bootstrap.



This was modeled after the www.apple.com/watch page as is on 06/21/2023 and completed on 09/10/2023 (the original site was still the same on completion.)
I tackled this project by trying to use only Bootstrap. 
***One plug-in was used: https://www.jqueryscript.net/slider/Fully-Responsive-Flexible-jQuery-Carousel-Plugin-slick.html***

The site was made to work on mobile/tablet/desktop per Bootstrap sizings. The site may not be 100% bug free but I am extremely proud of my first Bootstrap project!
I'm sure a lot of code may be able to be omitted, but this was my first project and I am continuously learning off of it in my future projects to reduce redundancy!

Existing Problems:
- Some reference comments still remain in the source code as it's not fully cleaned up but was pushed to my page.
- Dropdown at bottom of page is coded TWICE. One for large screens and laid out. One for dropdowns as I was not sure how to separate this with just Bootstrap.
            - Dropdowns on Bootstrap cause the giant space to be added when clicked. 
- Some sections may not fully scale properly when using Chrome Dev Tools (pictures may push text out of section borders on odd resolutions but seem fine on Bootstrap Sm/Md/Lg)
